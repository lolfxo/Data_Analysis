\title{Function to test whether two populations or samples have a significant difference in their means.}
\usage{
diff_of_prop(data0, data1, success0, success1, h0, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{data0:}{data representing the null hypothesis; data1: data representing the alternative hypothesis; h0: g/e/l for where the mean of data0 is greater, equal to or less than the mean of data1; alpha: significance level at which we test the difference in means; pop_mean0:}
}
\description{
This function allows us to take two data vectors, define a null hypothesis and a significance level to tell us whether the difference in the mean of the two data vectors are statistically significant or not.
